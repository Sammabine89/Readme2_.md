#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was our paying customer. Draw It or Lost It was already available on Android devices. The Gaming Room planned to upgrade the software and branch out to new devices. This text is meant to be straightforward and to the point.

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

UML diagram, software design template, game player management, and other components of the assignments and projects I had to produce. It's been fascinating learning how to plan out and utilize diagrams to describe game play before coding.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It may help you stay focused on the job at hand, prioritize your duties, and ignore the less crucial ones.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
It was difficult for me to make recommendations, even though I have a solid understanding on the essentials and the rationale behind them.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the game's features and helped divide them out so porting to other platforms would be easier and faster. While maintaining the status quo of the game. The customer may have requested your services, but the end-users are the ones who will ultimately have the last say. They won't utilize the program or buy more of it if they have doubts about its reliability.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I've focused on well-organized documentation and splitting apart game and game requirements features to make it simpler to roll out updates and do maintenance.
